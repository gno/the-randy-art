      Randolph Wayne Rotsell was born on March 10, 1955. He started
      making randyart as it as known today, sometime in the 80's or
      90's. Originally randyart was made using oil pants, and pens and
      xerox machines to do the rotation.

      Later, randyart moved digital, and for years was created using
      the gimp.
